## Lab 1 Graded: 94/100

Delivery: 3/5
- (-1) There is an error in your markdown subsection formatting. You did not put a space between the "#" and the beginning of your text. This is necessary in order to correctly format headings.
- (-1) You need to use code blocks to differentiate your commands from regular text. To do so, add \`\`\`bash [your code here] \`\`\`. For the future, if you are using other languages, you would replace the "bash" after the triple-ticks with your desired language.
A: 5/5
B: 5/5
C: 5/5
D: 10/10
E: 8/10
- (-2) Your output is not exactly correct. In your output, the values associated with CA and VA are 8 and 7 respectively. In the correct output, the values associated with CA and VA are 9 and 8. You seem to be sorting on individual characters, while you onlyneed to sort on states and given numbers. 
F: 10/10
G: 10/10
H: 38/40
- (-1) You not only want to check for the existence of the file but ensure that it is readable. You can do this using -r instead of -e. 
- (-1) There is a state code in the dataset that is 3 letters (UNK). Your checking for a 2 letter code won't work in this case.
